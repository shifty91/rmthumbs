# About #

This programm cleans up Windows files like Thumbs.db and desktop.ini. But why?
Imagine you copied some files from your Windows to your Linux/BSD machine. Of
course you don't need these files. This is why this tool removes them! But why
not using a simple shell command for that? Just because I had much fun to
implement this in C :).
